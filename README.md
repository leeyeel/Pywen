- 📈 **Session Statistics**: Real-time tracking of API calls, tool usage, and token consumption

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

We strongly recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to set up the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PAMPAS-Lab/Pywen.git
cd Pywen
uv venv
uv sync --all-extras

source .venv/bin/activate
```

### First Use

Simply run the `pywen` command to start:

```bash
pywen
```

If it's your first run and there's no configuration file, Pywen will automatically start the configuration wizard:

```
██████╗ ██╗   ██╗██╗    ██╗███████╗███╗   ██║
██╔══██╗╚██╗ ██╔╝██║    ██║██╔════╝████╗  ██║

╚═╝        ╚═╝    ╚══╝╚══╝ ╚══════╝╚═╝  ╚═══╝

Configuration file not found, starting setup wizard...

API Key: [Enter your Qwen API key]
Base URL: https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
Model: qwen3-coder-plus
...

✅ Configuration saved to pywen_config.json
```

After configuration is complete, you can start using Pywen!

### Basic Usage

Once you enter the Pywen command-line interface, you can:

```bash
# File operations
> Create a Python script to calculate Fibonacci sequence
> Refactor functions in main.py to make them more efficient

# Code analysis and debugging
> Fix bugs in this project and add unit tests
> Analyze performance bottlenecks in my code

# Project management
> Create a new Flask web application with proper structure
> Add comprehensive documentation to this codebase
```

## 📖 User Guide

### Command Line Interface

#### Available Commands

```bash
# System commands
/help, /?     - Show help information
/clear        - Clear screen and conversation history
/status       - Show agent status
/config       - Show current configuration
/stats        - Check session statistics (API calls, tokens, etc.)
/quit, /exit  - Exit Pywen

# Special commands
@<file>       - Include file content in prompt
!<command>    - Execute shell command

# Keyboard shortcuts
Ctrl+Y        - Toggle YOLO mode (auto-approve all operations - use with caution!)

# Direct input of task descriptions to execute agent
```

### YOLO Mode

**Use with caution:**
- Press `Ctrl+Y` to toggle YOLO mode
- **Default behavior**: All tool calls require user confirmation for safety
- In YOLO mode, all tool calls are automatically approved without user confirmation
- This speeds up execution but removes safety checks
- Mode status is displayed in the interface
- You can also type 'a' (always) when prompted for tool confirmation to enable YOLO mode

### Configuration Management

Pywen uses the `pywen_config.json` file for configuration:

```json
{
  "default_provider": "qwen",
  "max_steps": 20,
  "enable_lakeview": false,
  "model_providers": {
    "qwen": {
      "api_key": "your-qwen-api-key",
      "base_url": "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1",
      "model": "qwen3-coder-plus",
      "max_tokens": 4096,
      "temperature": 0.5
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Priority:**
1. Command line arguments (highest)
2. Configuration file values
3. Environment variables
4. Default values (lowest)

### Environment Variables

You can set API keys through environment variables:

```bash
# Qwen (required)
export QWEN_API_KEY="your-qwen-api-key"

# Tool API Keys (optional but recommended)
export SERPER_API_KEY="your-serper-api-key"  # For web search
export JINA_API_KEY="your-jina-api-key"      # For content reading

# Other supported providers
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
```
